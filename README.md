# pomodoro-timer
This project is a Pomodoro Timer made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. A traditional Pomodoro Timer is a timer with 25 minutes of work time, then a 5 minute break time, and then a 25 minute work time again. But, to make this project unique, I decided to make it customizable. You can now choose the amount of work time before and after the break time, and then the break time between. There are also three ringtones that you can choose from to notify you that you have reached a break time, a work time, or that the timer has completely ended. You can listen to the ringtones before you select one to use for the timer.
