# pomodoro-timer
This project is a Pomodoro Timer. A traditional Pomodoro Timer is a timer with 25 minutes of work time, then a 5 minute break time, and then a 25 minute work time again. But, to make this project unique, I decided to make it customizable. You can now choose the amount of work time before and after the break time, and then the break time between.
